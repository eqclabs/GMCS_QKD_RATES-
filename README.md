# GMCS_QKD_RATES-

Calculation of the Gaussian Modulated Coherent State  (CV)-QKD protocols 

- by setting the reconciliation efficinecy equal to $0$ and use the script in [tight_bound_leakage](https://github.com/eqclabs/tight_bound_leakage.git) , one can use a tight estimation of the leakage in non-binary LDPC Error Correction.
